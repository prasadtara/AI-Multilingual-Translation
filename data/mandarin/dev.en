Certainly, it mollifies China’s leaders, offering them a stronger incentive to continue to work within the existing international monetary regime.
Recent Chinese initiatives, especially the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, have given rise to fears that the country intends to build a new set of international institutions to compete with Western-dominated organizations like the IMF.
The decision to add the renminbi to the SDR basket may have put that danger into remission.
On the other hand, the move sets a worrying precedent, injecting politics into a policy area that had been governed by objective economic considerations.
Conceivably, over the longer term, China’s successful campaign could now open the door to lobbying by other governments to include their currencies as well.
Why not add the Swiss franc or the Canadian dollar?
Or, for that matter, why not include the Russian ruble or Indian rupee?
What was once the dignified preserve of obviously elite currencies could become the site of messy political battles for elevated status.
Of course, it can be argued that China’s recent economic trajectory means that it is only a matter of time before the renminbi does become a match for the SDR’s incumbents.
After all, international use of the currency has been growing exponentially.
But that optimistic assessment overestimates the renminbi’s prospects and illustrates the danger of linear extrapolation of the past into the future.
Likewise, use of the renminbi for the purpose of invoicing and settling trade with China is bound to continue growing.
But in terms of the all-important roles of a currency as an investment vehicle or reserve asset, the outlook for the renminbi is much less promising, owing to China’s still-tight capital controls and low level of financial development.
Nor is inclusion of the renminbi in the SDR basket likely to provide as big a boost to the currency’s internationalization as many believe.
Some central banks may decide to follow suit, adding renminbi-denominated assets to their reserves to match the composition of the basket.
But the increase will be marginal at best – some $40 billion in the next few years, according to the IMF’s calculations.
With global reserves now totaling more than $10 trillion, that is a mere drop in the proverbial bucket.
The political reasons for including the renminbi in the SDR are all too clear.
Unfortunately, the risks of doing so are no less obvious.
A Defeat for International Tax Cooperation
NEW YORK – Most of the world’s governments – eager to mobilize more tax revenues to finance development and curb pervasive tax-avoidance schemes, such as those revealed in the so-called Luxembourg Leaks scandal last year – have an interest in collaborating on taxation matters.
Yet at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa last month, the momentum toward strengthening international tax cooperation came to an abrupt halt.
Developed countries blocked a proposal at the conference to establish an intergovernmental tax body within the United Nations to replace the current UN Committee of Experts.
These countries insist that tax cooperation should take place exclusively under the leadership of the OECD, a body that they control.
The rest of the world should hope this will prove to be a pause rather than an end to progress on international tax cooperation, which began 13 years ago, at the first International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico.
Two years later, in 2004, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) upgraded its “ad hoc group” of tax experts to a regular committee.
This meant that the experts would meet regularly and have an expanded mandate that went beyond merely updating a model double-taxation treaty.
Four years later, at the Second Conference on Financing for Development, in Doha, Qatar, policymakers acknowledged that more needed to be done in tax matters, and asked ECOSOC to consider strengthening institutional arrangements.
And then, in the year leading up to the Addis Ababa conference, the UN Secretary-General endorsed the need for “an intergovernmental committee on tax cooperation, under the auspices of the United Nations.”
His endorsement, along with strong support from nongovernmental organizations and the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation, gave greater force to the demand by developing countries, organized around the Group of 77 and China, for an equal voice in setting global tax norms.
Up until the 11th hour of negotiations in Addis Ababa, they stood firm in calling for an intergovernmental body with the mandate and resources to create a coherent global framework for international tax cooperation.
But to no avail: Developed countries, led by the United States and the United Kingdom –home to many of the multinational corporations implicated in the “Lux Leaks” – succeeded in blocking this much-needed advance in global governance.
In the end, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda provides that the current Committee of Experts will continue to function according to its 2004 mandate, with three additional meeting days per year, all funded through voluntary contributions.
That is a profoundly disappointing outcome.
The developed countries have an argument – but not a convincing one.
The OECD, whose members are essentially the world’s 34 richest countries, certainly has the capacity to set international standards on taxation.
Yet the domination of a select group of countries over tax norms has meant that, in reality, the global governance architecture for taxation has not kept pace with globalization.
The Monterrey Consensus reached in 2002 included a call to enhance “the voice and participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making and norms-setting.”
But although the OECD invites some developing countries to participate in its discussions to establish norms, it offers them no decision-making power.
The OECD is thus a weak surrogate for a globally representative intergovernmental forum.
Such a body must operate under the auspices of the United Nations, which bears the institutional legitimacy necessary to respond effectively to the challenges of globalization with coherent global standards to combat abusive tax practices and ensure fair taxation of corporate profits worldwide.
Despite the disappointment in Addis Ababa, the call for reform of the international tax system is not likely to be silenced.
Instead, it will grow louder on all sides, as the developed countries’ counter-productive resistance to any give and take on international cooperation results in a tsunami of unilateral tax measures beyond OECD control.
The Making of Euro-Jihadism
MADRID – The Belgian historian Henri Pirenne linked Europe’s birth as a Christian continent in the eighth century to its rupture with Islam.
Pirenne probably would never have expected a Muslim ghetto in Brussels to emerge, much less become a hub of jihadism, with marginalized and angry young Muslims revolting against Europe from within its own borders.
Divorce is not an option these days.
But nor is the kind of marriage that the Islam scholar Tariq Ramadan advocates.
Ramadan, a grandson of the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, is a Swiss citizen and a resident of the United Kingdom who argues that Islamic ethics and values should be injected into the European system.
Europe would then not just tolerate Islam, but actually embrace it as an integral part of itself.
The problem with Ramadan’s vision is that Europe is an overwhelmingly secular continent, with a profoundly forward-thinking approach to ethics.
Islamic societies, by contrast, are both deeply religious and deeply embedded in the past.
When Islamists speak of political or social reform, they are typically looking backward, hoping to resurrect a time when core European principles – from gender equality to gay marriage – were repudiated.
Even Muslims who support the modernization of Islam would typically stop well short of Europe’s ethical vision.
The flaws in Ramadan’s proposed solution to Euro-jihadism mirror the flaws in his explanation for the phenomenon, which he attributes largely to Europe’s involvement in the wars in the Middle East, its supposed collusion with Israel’s suppression of the Palestinians, and its support of Arab autocrats.
“We cannot,” he writes, “support dictatorships … be silent when civilians are massacred south of our borders, and hope that we will not receive a response to the injustice and humiliation we have provoked.”
But it is the United States that launched wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, offers unconditional support to Israel, and has repeatedly propped up Arab autocrats.
And it is Europe that has consistently criticized these policies – often harshly.
Yet America is not being subjected to a major surge of jihadist sentiment within its borders.
It might have helped that US President Barack Obama backed away from some of these policies.
When the Arab Spring uprisings began, for example, he was quick to cut support for Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, allowing protesters – inspired by the Western model of democracy – to secure regime change.
The return to autocracy in Egypt in 2013, via Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s coup d’état, certainly was not aided by the US or Europe, both of which supported the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood.
Europe has offered even more direct help to Arab countries in recent years.
If it were not for Europe’s military intervention, Libyans would still be living under the tyrannical Muammar el-Qaddafi.
True, Europe could have done more to prevent the ensuing chaos in Libya.
But the people of Libya surely must take responsibility for the proliferation of competing militias that refuse to unite to save their state from total collapse.
More broadly, though the West – especially the US – has made grave policy errors in the Arab world over the last 50 years, external powers cannot be blamed entirely for the region’s meltdown.
That is the result of a profound civilizational crisis – one that can be redressed only by the people of the Arab world.
If Europe’s foreign policy is not responsible for the Arab world’s current turmoil, it certainly cannot be the reason for the rise of jihadism within its own borders.
The real problem lies at home: a disastrous deficit of effective policies related to social justice, education, housing, and employment for young European Muslims.
Marginalization generates frustration, which is subsequently fed by growing Islamophobia and the rise of raucous right-wing movements throughout the continent.
This link is apparent in the fact that the majority of European jihadists come from underprivileged backgrounds.
Not particularly well versed in the true teachings of Islam, and lacking opportunities to improve their lives, they become easy prey for extremists.
Jihadism, with its absolute certainty and grand mission, offers a sense of purpose, pride, and identity – not to mention adventure – and an outlet for their anger against the “home” that has denied them those things.
The story of America’s Muslims is the measure of Europe’s failure.
Like most Americans, Muslims in the US maintain a certain amount of faith in the American dream.
They are mostly middle class, and, despite all the talk about rising economic inequality, they have not given up on the belief that, in the US, hard work and initiative are rewarded.
America is a country of immigrants, with a dynamic economy that has enabled newcomers, time and again, to achieve great success.
In Europe, by contrast, improving one’s social standing has always been very difficult; and, at a time of economic stagnation and staggeringly high unemployment, it is not getting any easier.
Socially, America also offers something to Muslims that Europe does not.
Its fundamentally religious culture enables Muslims to retain their identity to a far greater extent than in secular Europe.
Indeed, America’s core values – personal responsibility and constitutional patriotism – can be easier for Muslims to swallow than Europe’s more aggressively secular brand of liberalism.
As a result, integration and assimilation tend to be easier for Muslims in America.
All of this suggests that Europe must look inward to address homegrown jihadism effectively.
This does not mean that it should temper its secularism, much less its liberal values.
Rather, Europe must breathe life into its own “European dream,” ensuring that all people have access to real opportunities to improve their lives.
Otherwise, it will face a lost generation of millions of young Europeans – Muslim and otherwise.
The New Climate Economics
NEW YORK – This Friday, in its latest comprehensive assessment of the evidence on global warming, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will show that the world’s climate scientists are more certain than ever that human activity – largely combustion of fossil fuels – is causing temperatures and sea levels to rise.
In recent years, a series of extreme weather events – including Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey, floods in China, and droughts in the American Midwest, Russia, and many developing countries – have caused immense damage.
Last week, Mexico experienced simultaneous hurricanes in the Pacific and in the Gulf of Mexico that devastated towns and cities in their path.
Climate change will be a major driver of such events, and we risk much worse.
This puts a new debate center stage: how to reconcile increased action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with strong economic growth.
It is a debate that is already mired in controversy.
As most countries have started making serious investments in renewable energy, and many are implementing carbon prices and regulations, critics complain that such policies may undermine growth.
With the global economy still recovering from the 2008 financial crash, higher energy costs – not yet fully offset by greater energy efficiency – are worrying business and political leaders.
The advent of shale gas has confused the energy debate even more.
If gas is substituted for coal, it can be a useful bridge to a low-carbon future.
But astonishingly, it is coal, the dirtiest fuel, that is experiencing the sharpest increase in use.
Companies and investors are hedging their bets by taking a few resource-efficiency measures and investing in some low-carbon assets, but leaving their high-carbon portfolios and activities largely intact.
Policy vacillation in some countries has not helped.
Advocates of stronger action respond that low-carbon investments can generate much stronger, cleaner growth.
They point to the savings available from energy efficiency, and to the market opportunities generated by clean-energy technologies as the processes of learning and discovery take hold.
They seek to demonstrate the benefits that a more sustainable pattern of development can bring to the world’s cities, to people’s health (from the reduction in air pollution), to energy security, and to the ability of the world’s poor to access energy.
And they propose green bonds and public investment banks to finance new infrastructure and jobs at a time when world interest rates are low and demand is depressed in many countries.
These are serious economic debates, but too often they have become entangled in ideological disputes about the appropriate response to the economic crisis and the value of government intervention in markets.
That is regrettable.
Climate change is not a partisan issue, and climate policy is essentially market-based.
It is about correcting market failures so that markets and entrepreneurship can play their proper role of ensuring innovation and efficient resource allocation.
In order to escape this impasse, we have helped to launch the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.
The Commission’s New Climate Economy project brings together seven leading policy research institutes from six continents, overseen by a panel of former heads of government and finance ministers and prominent business leaders, and advised by a panel of leading economists from across the world.
Its purpose is to provide authoritative new evidence concerning how governments and businesses can achieve stronger economic growth while simultaneously addressing climate risks.
Few governments or investors start from the standpoint of climate change.
They want to promote investment and economic growth, create jobs, stabilize public finances, expand markets, turn profits, ensure reliable energy and food supplies, produce goods and services, reduce poverty, and build cities.
So the primary question that we need to ask is not whether we can reduce emissions, but how public policy can help to achieve these core goals while reducing emissions and building a more climate-resilient economy.
There is now a lot of experience around the world in this area.
When the Stern Review on the economics of climate change was published seven years ago, the subject was largely theoretical.
Now countries at all stages of development are pursuing new patterns of economic growth that take climate into account.
Germany, for example, is planning the world’s most ambitious low-carbon energy transition, based on energy conservation and renewables.
South Korea has made “green growth” a central economic goal.
Mexico’s 2012 General Law on Climate Change has put it on course for a major increase in clean power.
China has placed the industrial development of green technologies at the top of its agenda.
Ethiopia is seeking to move to lower-carbon farming.
Brazil has significantly reduced the rate of deforestation in the Amazon.
Some major businesses are providing powerful examples of what is possible.
Unilever has committed to the sustainable sourcing of agricultural and forest products.
Coca-Cola is phasing out all use of climate-polluting hydrofluorocarbons.
The retail giant Wal-Mart is driving emissions reduction throughout its supply chain.
Meanwhile, the World Bank and the European Investment Bank have stopped lending to high-emission coal plants.
Yet genuine questions remain about how fast economies should move on to a low-carbon path, and the most effective way to do so.
Some low-carbon policies have clearly been expensive, while other, apparently cost-effective options, have not been pursued at all.
Any structural transformation involves costs, trade-offs, and uncertainties, and it is vital that we understand these properly.
Powerful interests will, of course, oppose any low-carbon transition, dismissing and often drowning out those who stand to benefit.
That makes it even more important to clarify the choices.
As science makes clear how imperative the climate question is, it is time for economists and policymakers to explain how it can be answered.
The Mouse Click that Roared
CAMBRIDGE – Until recently, cyber security has primarily interested computer geeks and cloak-and-dagger types.
The Internet’s creators, part of a small, enclosed community, were very comfortable with an open system in which security was not a primary concern.
But, with some three billion or so users on the Web nowadays, that very openness has become a serious vulnerability; indeed, it is endangering the vast economic opportunities that the Internet has opened for the world.
A “cyber attack” can take any number of forms, including simple probes, defacement of Web sites, denial-of-service attacks, espionage, and destruction of data.
And the term “cyber war,” though best defined as any hostile action in cyberspace that amplifies or is equivalent to major physical violence, remains equally protean, reflecting definitions of “war” that range from armed conflict to any concerted effort to solve a problem (for example, “war on poverty”).
Cyber war and cyber espionage are largely associated with states, while cyber crime and cyber terrorism are mostly associated with non-state actors.
The highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime; but, over the next decade or so, cyber war and cyber terrorism may become greater threats than they are today.
Moreover, as alliances and tactics evolve, the categories may increasingly overlap.
Terrorists might buy malware from criminals, and governments might find it useful to hide behind both.
Some people argue that deterrence does not work in cyberspace, owing to the difficulties of attribution.
But that is facile: inadequate attribution affects inter-state deterrence as well, yet it still operates.
Even when the source of an attack can be successfully disguised under a “false flag,” governments may find themselves sufficiently enmeshed in symmetrically interdependent relationships such that a major attack would be counterproductive.
China, for example, would lose from an attack that severely damaged the American economy, and vice versa.
An unknown attacker may also be deterred by cyber-security measures.
If firewalls are strong, or redundancy and resilience allow quick recovery, or the prospect of a self-enforcing response (“an electric fence”) seems possible, an attack becomes less attractive.
While accurate attribution of the ultimate source of a cyber attack is sometimes difficult, the determination does not have to be airtight.
To the extent that false flags are imperfect and rumors of the source of an attack are widely deemed credible (though not legally probative), reputational damage to an attacker’s soft power may contribute to deterrence.
Finally, a reputation for offensive capability and a declared policy that keeps open the means of retaliation can help to reinforce deterrence.
Of course, non-state actors are harder to deter, so improved defenses such as pre-emption and human intelligence become important in such cases.
But, among states, even nuclear deterrence was more complex than it first looked, and that is doubly true of deterrence in the cyber domain.
Given its global nature, the Internet requires a degree of international cooperation to be able to function.
Some people call for the cyber equivalent of formal arms-control treaties.
But differences in cultural norms and the difficulty of verification would make such treaties hard to negotiate or implement.
At the same time, it is important to pursue international efforts to develop rules of the road that can limit conflict.
The most promising areas for international cooperation today most likely concern problems posed for states by third parties such as criminals and terrorists.
Russia and China have sought to establish a treaty establishing broad international oversight of the Internet and “information security,” which would prohibit deception and embedding malicious code or circuitry that could be activated in the event of war.
But the US has argued that arms-control measures banning offensive capabilities could weaken defenses against attacks and would be impossible to verify or enforce.
Likewise, in terms of political values, the US has resisted agreements that could legitimize authoritarian governments’ censorship of the Internet – for example, by the “great firewall of China.”
Moreover, cultural differences impede any broad agreements on regulating online content.
Nonetheless, it may be possible to identify behaviors like cyber crime that are illegal in many domestic jurisdictions.
Trying to limit all intrusions would be impossible, but one could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism involving non-state parties.
Here, major states would have an interest in limiting damage by agreeing to cooperate on forensics and controls.
The transnational cyber domain poses new questions about the meaning of national security.
Some of the most important responses must be national and unilateral, focused on hygiene, redundancy, and resilience.
It is likely, however, that major governments will soon discover that the insecurity created by non-state cyber actors will require closer cooperation among governments.
A Practical Agenda for Revolutionary Times
OXFORD – As the world’s financial leaders gather for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, many working people around the world are demanding radical change, because they sense that their voices are not being heard.
Those who are supposed to represent them should not ignore this anger and frustration any longer.
According to the 2017 Edelman Trust Barometer, the public’s confidence in the status quo has collapsed worldwide, owing to widely held concerns about globalization, innovation, immigration, the erosion of social values, and corruption.
At the same time, the response from elites who regard themselves as the guardians of economic growth has sometimes made matters worse.
If they think they can allay public concerns simply by explaining the benefits of the current global economic system and tweaking policies to compensate those left behind, they are in for a rude awakening.
Earlier this month, the IMF, World Bank, and World Trade Organization published a joint report extolling the benefits of trade as a driver of productivity growth, competition, and consumer choice.
The report’s argument in favor of free trade is not new, nor is its recommendation that “active labor-market policies” be used to cushion the blow of lost jobs and livelihoods.
What is new is that repeating these claims, without also addressing people’s deeper concerns, can now do more harm than good.
Global public opinion has changed dramatically in recent years.
A majority of people worldwide – and up to 72% of people in France and Italy – now believe that the system has failed them.
Moreover, only 29% of people across 28 countries now trust government leaders, while three-quarters of those surveyed say they trust reformers who would upend the status quo.
These findings suggest that those defending free trade have lost credibility with the people they hope to persuade.
World leaders need to recognize that today’s populist revolts are being fueled by a sense of lost dignity – a sentiment that does not factor into most policymakers’ prescription for economic growth and compensatory payments.
Working-class voters have lashed out because they feel not just economically abandoned, but also socially disdained and culturally marginalized.
Their vote is the only means they have left to hit back at the establishment.
To address the public’s concerns requires a three-part agenda.
The first order of business should be to reach out to those who feel voiceless and unrepresented.
During the US presidential campaign, Donald Trump tapped into this sentiment when he vowed to punish any company that moves jobs to China or Mexico.
As the filmmaker Michael Moore explained prior to the election, American working-class voters were desperate to hear someone promise to take on big business.
The fact that it took a populist plutocrat to do it underscores the extent to which the American labor movement has been extinguished.
Political parties that originally emerged from the labor movement have long since shifted to the “center.”
They now accept political contributions from big business, and have accordingly adopting the language of common prosperity and “consensus politics,” leaving the many working people who do not share in that prosperity and consensus feeling disregarded and displaced.
Second, the quality of work, and the status that it confers, must be improved.
In wealthy countries, precarious, poorly paid, and even dangerous forms of employment are becoming increasingly common.
A recent Bloomberg Businessweek story describes how temporary workers at auto-parts factories in Alabama are paid just $7.25 per hour, and must work in hazardous conditions with no safety training.
In 2010, these workers suffered work injuries at a 50% higher rate than unionized auto-parts workers elsewhere.
As the OECD has shown, “non-standard” work is proliferating globally.
This trend is contributing to deteriorating working conditions, making workers feel increasingly helpless and vulnerable.
Reversing it will require robust standards to ensure workplace safety, fair pay, and the right to enter into collective-bargaining arrangements.
Governments will have to intervene to set these standards, as they did during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to improve abysmal conditions in factories.
Otherwise, businesses will not be able to behave decently, for fear of being undercut by unscrupulous competitors.
Finally, more opportunities must be created for the next generation – and not just economic opportunities.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, many governments have reduced their investments in health, education, housing, and other forms of human capital.
Many have also cut support for the unemployed, homeless, or indebted.
As a result, those who have fallen behind are deprived not just of resources, but, more important, the chance to pursue their aspirations.
As the IMF, World Bank, and WTO show in their report, free trade and globalization have certainly increased the size of the overall economic pie.
In theory, this should have expanded governments’ capacity to compensate those left behind and create the conditions for them to get ahead.
In fact, the opposite has happened, owing to government cutbacks since 2008.
The establishment’s agenda has been failing for too long.
And as elites continue to proclaim the benefits of free trade and globalization, they are merely widening the chasm of popular mistrust.
Over the past year, that mistrust has boiled over in many countries, with voters in one election after another rejecting the status quo.
Piecemeal curbs on globalization will not be enough to quell the revolt.
Instead, world leaders must leave their echo chamber, take ordinary people’s concerns seriously, diversify their views, and think about why so many have lost faith in the system.
The Development Costs of Homophobia
LONDON – As a gay man living in Nigeria, my biggest challenge was choosing between my sexuality and my job.
In 2004, I was at the start of my acting career.
I had just left university, and I was featured in “Roses and Thorns,” a prime-time soap opera on Galaxy Television, one of Nigeria’s most popular TV stations. I was playing the role of “Richard,” the only son of a rich family who was having an affair with the house maid.
Whispers were making the rounds about my private life, and I decided it was time to come out.
So I agreed to go on Nigeria’s most-watched television talk show to discuss my sexuality.
Almost immediately, my character was eliminated.
And when my job disappeared, so did my financial security.
Like many gay men and lesbians in Africa, my choice was between economic freedom and mental imprisonment.
This year, Nigeria and Uganda put in place draconian anti-gay laws, sparking a worldwide debate about human rights.
This debate has also started at the World Bank, whose president, Jim Yong Kim, recently declared that “institutionalized discrimination is bad for people and for societies.”
Kim’s statement has invited criticism and controversy.
Often, as in Uganda and Nigeria, we hear the claim that opposition to official discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people is simply a way to impose “Western” values on Africa.
But this assumes that homosexuality is “un-African.”
And, despite the absence of evidence that any given country or continent does not have LGBT people (and ample evidence to the contrary), it is an assumption that an increasing number of African leaders have embraced.
In 2006, President Olusegun Obasanjo, then Nigeria’s president, was among the first to do so.
Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni followed suit when signing the anti-gay bill into law in 2014.
Other leaders, from Gambia’s President Yahya Jammeh to Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, have spoken in the same vein.
These official attitudes have caused significant suffering for Africa’s gays and lesbians.
Indeed, the price of homophobia for gay people in many African countries is painfully clear: legal penalties, social ostracism, and mob justice.
But here is what Africa’s anti-gay leaders miss: legal protections are not only a human-rights issue, but also an economic issue.
Kim is exactly right, and research has started measuring the economic costs of homophobia by exploring links between anti-gay sentiment and poverty in countries where laws and social attitudes proscribe same-sex relationships.
M.V. Lee Badgett, an economist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, presented the initial findings of a study of the economic implications of homophobia in India at a World Bank meeting in March 2014.
Badgett estimated that the Indian economy may have lost up to $23.1 billion in 2012 in direct health costs alone, owing to depression, suicide, and HIV treatment disparities caused by anti-gay stigma and discrimination.
In addition to such concrete costs, being gay can bring violence, job loss, family rejection, harassment in schools, and pressure to marry.
As a result, many gay people have less education, lower productivity, lower earnings, poorer health, and a shorter life expectancy.
In Nigeria, I started the Independent Project for Equal Rights (TIERs) in 2005 to respond to the increasing number of people who were losing their jobs because of suspicions about their sexuality.
During our first year, we provided support for dozens of people.
One young man, “Olumide,” was given temporary housing after his family kicked him out for being gay.
Another, “Uche,” was fired from his job as a chef after his sexuality was revealed.
TIERs helped him with accommodation and capital to set up a catering business.
Though almost 10 years have passed, it is still not safe to use their real names.
Across Africa, the economic costs of discrimination are increasing, in line with growing pressure on employers, landlords, health-care providers, educational institutions, and others to exclude LGBT people.
Today, the World Bank and other development agencies are mapping out the global development priorities that will follow the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which officially end in 2015 and included specific targets for promoting gender equality and empowering women as a strategy for economic growth.
Looking ahead, the Bank should take the same approach to LGBT rights and make legal protections for sexual orientation and gender identity a condition for countries receiving loans.
Building recognition of women’s rights into the MDGs did not corrupt African cultures by imposing “Western” values; in fact, it strengthened many African countries, which now lead the world in the representation of women in government.
By pursuing similar protections for LGBT people, international investment and aid can improve economic performance and strengthen respect for basic human rights.
The World Bank, always wary of entangling itself in “political” questions, emphasizes that it is not a global human-rights enforcer.
But it also increasingly recognizes its own role as a facilitator in helping Bank members realize their human-rights obligations.
LGBT rights should be a test case.
Aid to governments that permit specific social groups to be ostracized can carry very real economic costs.
As new loans are considered, steps should be taken to ensure that the benefits are as inclusive as possible.
If the Bank – which currently lends Nigeria almost $5.5 billion and expects to commit an additional $2 billion in each of the next four years – moved in this direction, other funders might follow.
Africa’s LGBT people desperately need such powerful allies in their struggle for human and economic rights.
A Democratic Burma?
TOKYO – Historic transformations often happen when least expected.
Mikhail Gorbachev’s liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union emerged at one of the Cold War’s darkest hours, with US President Ronald Reagan pushing for strategic missile defense and the two sides fighting proxy wars in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
Deng Xiaoping’s economic opening followed China’s bloody – and failed – invasion of Vietnam in 1978.
And South Africa’s last apartheid leader, F. W. de Klerk, was initially perceived as just another apologist for the system – hardly the man to free Nelson Mandela and oversee the end of white minority rule.
Now the world is suddenly asking whether Burma (Myanmar), after six decades of military dictatorship, has embarked on a genuine political transition that could end the country’s pariah status.
Is Burma, like South Africa under de Klerk, truly poised to emerge from a half-century of self-imposed isolation?
And can Aung San Suu Kyi, the heroic opposition leader, and Thein Sein, Burma’s new president, engineer a political transition as skillfully and peacefully as Mandela and de Klerk did for South Africa in the early 1990’s?
Despite her two decades of house arrest and isolation, Suu Kyi possesses two of the gifts that enabled Mandela to carry out his great task: a reassuring serenity and an utter lack of vindictiveness.
As Burma’s authorities test reform, these gifts, together with her negotiating skills and, most of all, her vast moral authority, will be tested as never before.
Moreover, unlike Mandela during his 27-year imprisonment, Suu Kyi has had her hopes raised – and dashed – before.
In the mid-1990’s, and again in 2002-2003, reconciliation between Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) and the military junta seemed to be in the offing.
On both occasions, however, the regime’s hardliners gained the upper hand, crushing prospects for reform.
Yet Suu Kyi, and much of the Burmese opposition, is beginning to admit that today’s political liberalization might be the real thing.
Because Burma’s generals say almost nothing in public, it is difficult to fathom why they allowed elections that elevated Thein Sein to power, or to explain their willingness to embrace dialogue with the long-suppressed opposition.
Recent events suggest one possible explanation: Burma’s rulers have grown wary of China’s almost smothering embrace – a result of the country’s international isolation.
Indeed, public protests against China’s commercial exploitation of Burma’s natural resources became so widespread that the government called a halt to construction by Chinese investors on the huge and environmentally damaging Myitsone Dam on the Irrawaddy River.
Thein Sein’s decision to halt the project is clearly an important policy shift.
It is also a signal to the outside world that Burma’s new government may be much more willing than any of its predecessors to heed both public pressure and international opinion, both of which vehemently opposed the dam’s construction.
Almost simultaneously, Thein Sein offered even stronger signals that his was a very different Burmese administration: he freed political prisoners and invited Suu Kyi for direct talks with him.
Indeed, Suu Kyi now enjoys far greater freedom of movement than she has at any time since she received the Nobel Peace Prize 20 years ago, and the NLD recently announced that it will field candidates in the forthcoming by-elections to the country’s newly established parliament.
If Suu Kyi is permitted to campaign free of restraint, for both her own seat and to boost the electoral chances of her NLD colleagues, it will be clear that Thein Sein and his government are truly determined to bring their country in from the cold.
For both Suu Kyi and Thein Sein, every step from now on will be delicate, to be calibrated with the same care and deliberation that Mandela and de Klerk used in bridging their differences and leading their country out of isolation.
But the international community, too, must act with great care.
While Thein Sein would undoubtedly wish to see the myriad economic and political sanctions imposed on Burma quickly lifted, it is too soon for a general easing of such measures.
But the outside world should demonstrate that every clear move toward greater political openness will merit more international political and economic engagement.
The Japan Investment Bank’s decision to invest in port development in Burma – essential if the economy, too, is to be opened – is one positive sign that the world will keep pace with Thein Sein step for step.
And US President Barack Obama’s decision to send Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Burma to meet Thein Sein is another clear sign that the world is ready to end the country’s isolation.
Closer to home, ASEAN’s recent decision to give Burma a chance to chair the organization in 2014 underscores its neighbors’ desire for the country’s full participation in Asia’s growing prosperity.
No one should rush to judgment yet, but Thein Sein’s decisions, at least so far, are beginning to resemble those of South Africa’s de Klerk when he initiated his country’s reform process.
Fortunately, Burma already has in Aung San Suu Kyi its very own Nelson Mandela.
A Devaluation Option for Southern Europe
CAMBRIDGE – This year is likely to mark a make-or-break ordeal for the euro.
The eurozone’s survival demands a credible solution to its long-running sovereign-debt crisis, which in turn requires addressing the two macroeconomic imbalances – external and fiscal – which are at the heart of that crisis.
The crisis has exposed the deep disparities in competitiveness that have developed within the eurozone.
From 1996 to 2010, unit labor costs in Germany increased by just 8%, and by 13% in France. Compare that to 24% in Portugal, 35% in Spain, 37% in Italy, and a whopping 59% in Greece.
The result has been large trade imbalances between eurozone countries, a problem compounded by large fiscal deficits and high levels of public debt in southern Europe (and France) – much of it owed to foreign creditors.
Does addressing these imbalances require breaking up the eurozone?
Suppose, for example, that Portugal were to leave and re-introduce the escudo. The ensuing exchange-rate devaluation would immediately lower the price of Portugal’s exports, raise its import prices, stimulate the economy, and bring about much-needed growth.
But a euro exit would be a messy affair. The resulting turmoil could very well trump any short-term gains in competitiveness from devaluation.
There is a remarkably simple alternative that does not require southern Europe’s troubled economies to abandon the euro and devalue their exchange rates.
