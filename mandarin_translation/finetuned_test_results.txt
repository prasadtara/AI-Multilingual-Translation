PRED: If some fear that the currency’s devaluation will conflict with the euro’s rules, one could cite Germany’s example.

ZH: 一位中国的异议人士
REF: A Dissident in China
PRED: A Chinese dissident.

[25]
ZH: 东京 — — 对于中国而言， 2009 年可是一个好年头。
REF: TOKYO – 2009 was a good year for China. The Chinese economy still roared ahead in the midst of a worldwide recession.
PRED: TOKYO – For China, 2009 is a good year.

[26]
ZH: 在全球一片衰退的景象之中，中国经济却独领风骚、大步前进；美国总统贝拉克·奥巴马在他的中国之行中，表现的更像是一位置身帝国宫廷内的有求之人，而非一名全球最强超级大国的元首；甚至连关于气候变化问题的哥本哈根峰会，都以令中国称心如意的方式落幕：它未能令中国或其他任何一个工业国承担起重大的减排义务，而此罪责却由美国承担。
REF: American President Barack Obama visited China, more in the spirit of a supplicant to an imperial court than the leader of the world’s greatest superpower.

PRED: In the face of a global recession, China’s economy has led the way; in his trip to China, US President Barack Obama has behaved more like a man in need in the imperial court than a head of the world’s most powerful super-Power; and even the Copenhagen summit on climate change has ended in such a way that China is satisfied that it has not been able to impose major emission reduction obligations on China or any other industrial country, for which the US bears the responsibility.

[27]
ZH: 共产党领导下的中国政府有充分的理由感到自信。
REF: The Chinese government, under the Communist Party, has every reason to feel confident.
PRED: The Chinese government, led by the Communist Party, has every reason to feel confident.

[28]
ZH: 这样，为何一位儒雅的原文学教授（刘晓波）却仅仅因为公开倡导言论自由及一党统治的终结，而要被判处十一年徒刑呢？
REF: So why did a gentle former literature professor named Liu Xiaobo have to be sentenced to 11 years in prison, just because he publicly advocated freedom of expression and an end to one-party rule?
PRED: Why, then, would a Confucian professor of originals (Lu Xiaobo) be sentenced to 11 years in prison simply because he openly advocated freedom of speech and the end of one-party rule?

[29]
ZH: 刘晓波是 2008 年的请愿文件 — — 《 08 宪章》的共同作者，这份呼吁尊重基本权利的文件，业已征得数千中国人的签名。
REF: Liu was co-author in 2008 of a petition, Charter 08, signed by thousands of Chinese, calling for basic rights to be respected.
PRED: Liu Xiaobo, co-author of the 2008 petition, Charter 08, which calls for respect for fundamental rights, has been signed by thousands of Chinese.

PRED: Liu Xiaobo, who is not a violent rebel, expressed his views in an article published on the Internet, is completely unconscionable.

REF: The notion that Liu might be capable of subverting the immense power of the Communist Party of China is patently absurd.
PRED: The argument that Liu Xiaobo is capable of undermining the Chinese Communist Party’s enormous power is clearly a lie.

[33]
ZH: 然而当局却明显相信：自己必须杀一儆百，以防他人发表类似观点。
REF: And yet the authorities clearly believe that they had to make an example of him, to prevent others from expressing similar views.
PRED: The authorities, however, clearly believe that they must make an example to prevent others from expressing similar views.

[34]
ZH: 为何对于一个看似稳固的政权来说，那些纯粹的观点、或者甚至是和平的请愿活动，却被认为是如此危险呢？
REF: Why does a regime that appears to be so secure consider mere opinions, or even peaceful petitions, so dangerous?
PRED: Why are those mere views, or even peaceful petitions, considered so dangerous for a seemingly stable regime?

[35]
ZH: 这或许是因为该政权并不像它看上去那般坦然无惧。
REF: Perhaps because the regime does not feel as secure as it looks.
PRED: That may be because the regime is not as clean as it looks.

[36]
ZH: 若失去了合法性，任何政府都无法自信地施行统治。
REF: Without legitimacy, no government can rule with any sense of confidence. There are many ways to legitimize political arrangements.
PRED: If legitimacy is lost, no government can govern confidently.

[37]
ZH: 为政治制度赋予合法性的方式多种多样：自由民主制只是近来的一种创新而已；通常由君权神授为依托的世袭君主制，曾在历史上大行其道；而某些现代的独裁者（如罗伯特·穆加贝 ） ， 则是以民族解放斗士这一资历作为其统治的依据。
REF: Hereditary monarchy, often backed by divine authority, has worked in the past. And some modern autocrats, such as Robert Mugabe, have been bolstered by their credentials as national freedom fighters.
PRED: There are many ways to give legitimacy to the political system: liberal democracy is a recent innovation; the inherited monarchy, often mandated by the monarchy, has done well in history; and some modern dictators, such as Robert Mugabe, have based their rule on their qualifications as national liberation fighters.

[38]
ZH: 中国在过去的一个世纪内发生了巨大的变化，但在某一个方面，它却依然如故：宗教式的政治观念仍在统御着这个国家。
REF: China has changed a great deal in the last century, but it has remained the same in one respect: it is still ruled by a religious concept of politics.
PRED: China has changed dramatically in the last century, but in one way or another it remains the same: religious politics continues to dominate the country.

[39]
ZH: 这种观念的合法性并非基于互谅互让、讨价还价以及做出必要的妥协；而这些行为构成了经济式政治观念的基础，其中，自由民主制度的支柱便是一例。
REF: Legitimacy is not based on the give and take, the necessary compromises, and the wheeling and dealing that form the basis of an economic concept of politics such as that which underpins liberal democracy.
PRED: The legitimacy of this notion is not based on mutual accommodation, bargaining, and the necessary compromises; these acts form the basis of economic politics, for example, the pillars of liberal democracy.

[40]

REF: Instead, the foundation of religious politics is a shared belief, imposed from above, in ideological orthodoxy.

[45]
ZH: 在二十世纪前期数十年的种种革命之后，儒家思想被中国式的共产主义所取代。
REF: After the various revolutions in the early decades of the twentieth century, Confucianism was replaced by a Chinese version of Communism.
PRED: After the revolutions of the early decades of the twentieth century, Confucian ideology was replaced by Chinese Communism.

[46]
ZH: 对于中国的知识分子而言，马克思主义颇具吸引力，这一方面是因为它带着书卷的气息，引入了一套现代道德正统观念；另一方面则是因为马克思主义与儒家学说一样，都建立在一种关于完美和谐的诺言基础之上：在共产主义乌托邦内，最终将再无利益的冲突。
REF: Marxism appealed to Chinese intellectuals, because it was bookish, introduced a modern moral orthodoxy, and was based, like Confucianism, on a promise of perfect harmony. Ultimately, in the Communist utopia, conflicts of interests would melt away.
PRED: For China’s intellectuals, Marxism is attractive, because it has introduced a modern moral orthodoxy with its books; and because Marxism, like Confucianism, is based on a promise of perfect harmony: in Communism utopia, there will eventually be no conflict of interest.

[47]
ZH: 毛泽东主席的统治，便是对中国帝制体系与共产主义极权制度诸元素的结合。
REF: Chairman Mao’s rule combined elements of the Chinese imperial system with Communist totalitarianism.

[48]

REF: Out of this crisis came the demonstrations all over China, collectively known as “Tiananmen.”
PRED: The crisis has led to demonstrations throughout China, which have been held in the name of the Tiananmen incident.

[52]
ZH: 刘晓波在 1989 年，便身为学生针对官员腐化、并要求获得更大自由的抗议活动之积极代言人。
REF: Liu Xiaobo was an active spokesman in 1989 for the student protests against official corruption and in favor of greater freedom.
PRED: Liu Xiaobo was the active voice of students in 1989 in protests against officials who corrupted and demanded greater freedom.

[53]
ZH: 在天安门的血腥镇压行动后不久，一种新的正统思想取代了中国式马克思主义的地位，这便是中国的民族主义。
REF: Soon after the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen, a new orthodoxy replaced Chinese Marxism: Chinese nationalism.
PRED: Shortly after Tiananmen’s bloody repression, a new orthodox ideology replaced Chinese Marxism, China’s nationalism.

[54]
ZH: 只有一党统治，方可确保中国能继续崛起，并为数百年的民族屈辱史画上句号；共产党代表着中国的大国宿命。
REF: Only one-party rule would guarantee the continuing rise of China and put an end to centuries of national humiliation.
PRED: Only one-party rule can ensure that China continues to rise and end its centuries-old history of ethnic humiliation; the Communist Party represents China’s destiny.

[55]
ZH: 对���观点心存疑虑已不单是一种错误，还是一种不爱国、甚至“反华”的表现。
REF: The Communist Party represented China’s destiny as a great power. To doubt this was not just mistaken, but unpatriotic, even “anti-Chinese.”
PRED: Doubts about views are not only a mistake, but also an unpatriotic and even “anti-China” expression.

[56]
ZH: 以此看来，刘晓波的批判观点的确是颠覆性的。
REF: From this perspective, Liu Xiaobo’s critical views were indeed subversive.
PRED: In this sense, Liu Xiaobo’s critical views are indeed subversive.

[57]
ZH: 这些观点为官方正统思想打上了问号，也由此对国家政权的合法性提出了质疑。
REF: They cast doubt on the official orthodoxy, and thus on the legitimacy of the state.
PRED: These views cast a question mark on official orthodoxy, thus calling into question the legitimacy of the national regime.

[58]
ZH: 许多人对于中国政府为何拒绝在 1989 年与学生进行谈判、或对如今的批判者做出一些迁就而感到惊讶，这恰恰是误解了宗教式政治的本质。
REF: To wonder, as many have, why the Chinese regime refused to negotiate with the students in 1989 – or to find some accommodation with its critics today – is to misunderstand the nature of religious politics.
PRED: Many are surprised by the Chinese government’s refusal to negotiate with students in 1989 or to accommodate today’s critics, which is precisely a misunderstanding of the essence of religious politics.

[59]
ZH: 谈判、妥协与迁就皆为经济式政治的特征， 这种政治模式可以就事论事； 与之形成鲜明对比的是，那些根据共有信念施行统治的人，是无力承担谈判之代价的，因为谈判行为将会对信念本身造成伤害。
REF: Negotiation, compromise, and accommodation are the marks of economic politics, where every deal has its price. By contrast, those who rule according to a shared belief cannot afford to negotiate, for that would undermine the belief itself.
PRED: Negotiation, compromise, and change are all features of economic politics, a political model that can be case-by-case; by contrast, those who rule on the basis of a shared belief are unable to bear the cost of the negotiations, because the conduct of the negotiations will hurt the belief itself.

[60]
ZH: 这并非意味着经济式政治观念对于中国人来说，是一种完全陌生的模式；就此而言，这也不是指奉行民主制度的西方就不知宗教式政治观念为何物。
REF: This is not to say that the economic concept of politics is utterly strange to the Chinese – or, for that matter, that the religious notion of politics is unknown in the democratic West.
PRED: This does not mean that economic-style politics is a completely alien model for Chinese; nor, to that end, that the West, which pursues democracy, knows nothing about religious-style politics.

[61]
ZH: 然而在中国，人们对于正统观念的坚持，依旧强大到使其足可继续作为对政治批评者的默认防范方式之地步。
REF: But the insistence on orthodoxy is still sufficiently strong in China to remain the default defense against political critics.
PRED: In China, however, adherence to the notion of orthodoxy remains strong enough for it to continue as a default precaution for political critics.

[62]
ZH: 这些情况可以发生转变。
REF: These things can change.
PRED: These things can change.

[63]
ZH: 诸如韩国、台湾以及日本等其他的儒家社会，如今都已拥有繁荣的自由民主制度，人们没有理由相信：中国不可能经历这种转型。
REF: Other Confucian societies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, now have thriving liberal democracies, and there is no reason to believe that such a transition is impossible in China.
PRED: Other Confucian societies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, now have flourishing liberal democracy, and there is no reason to believe that China cannot experience such a transition.

[64]
ZH: 但外部压力不太可能带来这种变革。
REF: But external pressure is unlikely to bring it about.
PRED: But external pressure is unlikely to bring about such change.

REF: Many non-Chinese, including me, have signed a letter of protest against the jailing of Liu Xiaobo.
PRED: Many foreign figures, including me, have signed a letter of protest against Liu Xiaobo’s imprisonment.

[66]
ZH: 人们只是希望此举能聊表慰藉，并给予那些与刘晓波志同道合的中国人以道义上的鼓舞；但对于那些笃信当前中国民族主义正统思想的人士而言，此举不太可能令其受到震动。
REF: One hopes that this will lend comfort to him, and give a moral boost to Chinese who share his views. But it is unlikely to impress those who believe in the current orthodoxy of Chinese nationalism.
PRED: One simply hopes that it will serve as a source of comfort and moral inspiration for those Chinese like Liu Xiaobo Chi; but, for those who believe in the current Chinese nationalist orthodoxy, it is unlikely that it will be shaken.

[67]
ZH: 在中国从宗教式政治的控制下获得解放之前，刘晓波的理念不太可能生根。
REF: Until China is released from the grip of religious politics, Liu’s ideals are unlikely to take root.
PRED: Until China is liberated from religious politics, Liu Xiaobo’s ideas are unlikely to take root.

[68]
ZH: 对于中国（实际上也对世界其他国家）而言，这可不是个好兆头。
REF: This does not bode well for China, or, indeed, for the rest of the world.
PRED: This does not augur well for China (and, indeed, for the rest of the world).

[69]
ZH: 不由分说的禁毒战争
REF: A Drug War on Auto-Pilot
PRED: The war on drugs, by no means.

[70]
ZH: 海牙 — — 阿富汗战争迄今为止已经打了十年，在很多人看来或许仍没有结束的迹象，但拉丁美洲却忍受了更为漫长的战争，而且近来血腥程度甚至愈演愈烈： 这就是打击贩毒的“战争 ” 。
REF: THE HAGUE – The war in Afghanistan, now approaching its tenth year, may seem to many to have no end in sight, but Latin America has endured an even longer fight, one that has recently become much more bloody: the “war” against drug trafficking.

ZH: 在这两种危机得到恰当应对之前，西方世界将继续背负着增长滞缓、失业率长期居高及收入与财富差距过大的负担。
REF: Until both are addressed properly, the West will remain burdened by sluggish growth, persistently high unemployment, and excessive income and wealth inequality.
PRED: Until these two crises are properly addressed, the Western world will continue to bear the burden of slow growth, long-term high unemployment, and excessive income and wealth gaps.

[145]
ZH: 主权债务危机是众所周知的。
REF: The sovereign-debt crisis is well known.
PRED: The sovereign debt crisis is well known.

[146]
ZH: 为了避免出现经济萧条，各国政府在全球金融危机期间都忙于实施财政及货币刺激政策。
REF: In order to avert a likely depression, governments around the world engaged in fiscal and monetary stimulus in the midst of the global financial crisis.
PRED: To avoid a recession, governments were busy with fiscal and monetary stimulus during the global financial crisis.

[147]
ZH: 此举成功抵消了因私营部门去杠杆化所导致的严重经济紊乱，但却是以破坏自身财政收支平衡以及扰乱央行资产负债表为代价的。
REF: They succeeded in offsetting nasty economic dislocations caused by private-sector deleveraging, but at the cost of encumbering their fiscal balances and their central banks’ balance sheets.
PRED: This succeeded in offsetting the severe economic disorder caused by private-sector deleveraging, but at the cost of undermining its fiscal balance and disrupting its central bank balance sheet.

[148]
ZH: 虽然主权信贷的质量几乎全面恶化 — — 并很可能继续恶化下去 — — 但它对各国的影响却有所不同。
REF: While sovereign credit quality has deteriorated virtually across the board, and will most probably continue to do so, the implications for individual countries vary.
PRED: While the quality of sovereign credit has deteriorated almost completely – and is likely to continue to worsen – its impact has varied across countries.

[149]
ZH: 某些西方国家 — — 比如希腊 — — 起初其政府账目就非常糟糕，所以很快就陷入了长期持续性的危机模式。
REF: Some Western countries – such as Greece – had fragile government accounts from the outset and tipped quickly into persistent crisis mode.
PRED: Some Western countries, like Greece, whose government’s accounts were initially bad, quickly plunged into a long-term pattern of crisis.

[150]
ZH: 这些国家将一直深陷危机，即便很长一段时期之后都依然无法为其公民带来一丝希望。
REF: There they remain, still failing to provide citizens with a light at the end of what already has been a long tunnel.
PRED: These countries will remain mired in crises that, even after a long time, will not provide a glimmer of hope for their citizens.

[151]
ZH: 其他国家过去在财政上一直尽职尽责，却无力应对那些从别处承担的债务（例如那些不可靠的爱尔兰银行就毁了本国的预算 ） 。
REF: Other countries had been fiscally responsible, but were overwhelmed by the liabilities that they had assumed from others (for example, Ireland’s irresponsible banks sank their budget).
PRED: Others have been fiscally diligent in the past, but have been unable to cope with debt from elsewhere (e.g., unreliable Irish banks have destroyed their own budgets).

[152]
ZH: 另外一些国家 — — 包括美国 — — 没有受到直接的威胁，但无法在某些长期事务上取得进展。 而有几个像德国这样的国家则通过多年的财政纪律和体制改革拥有了深厚的经济和金融复原能力。
REF: Still others, including the United States, faced no immediate threat but failed to make progress on longer-term issues. A few, like Germany, had built deep economic and financial resilience through years of fiscal discipline and structural reforms.
PRED: Others – including the US – have not been directly threatened, but have not been able to make progress on some long-term issues. And several countries like Germany have had strong economic and financial resilience through years of fiscal discipline and institutional reforms.

[153]
ZH: 各国的应对政策各不相同，这也并不奇怪。
REF: It is not surprising that policy approaches have also varied.
PRED: It is not surprising that countries have different policy responses.

[154]
ZH: 但事实上，这些政策之间只拥有一个至关重要（也令人失望）的共同点：那就是无法依靠经济快速增长这个“最安全”的方法来为其过度负债的经济去杠杆化。
REF: Indeed, they have shared only one, albeit crucial (and disappointing) feature: the inability to rely on rapid growth as the “safest” way to deleverage an over-indebted economy.
PRED: But, in fact, there is only one essential (and disappointing) common denominator between these policies: rapid economic growth, the “safest” method, cannot be relied on to deleveraging its over-indebted economy.

[155]
ZH: 希腊实际上已经在某些债务上出现了违约。
REF: Greece essentially defaulted on some obligations.
PRED: Greece has actually defaulted on some debts.

[156]

[158]
ZH: 而德国正逐渐适应在国内需求方面的稳健相对扩张。
REF: And Germany is slowly acquiescing to a prudent relative expansion in domestic demand.
PRED: Germany, for its part, is adapting to robust relative expansion in domestic demand.

[159]
ZH: 关于主权债务危机我想说的就这么多，因为考虑��其对国家、区域及全球的影响，对其的讨论已经足够丰富了。
REF: So much for the sovereign-debt crisis, which, given its national, regional, and global impact, has been particularly well covered.
PRED: That is all I want to say about the sovereign debt crisis, because there is enough discussion about it, given its national, regional, and global implications.

[160]
ZH: 毕竟，它之所以被称之为主权，就是因为它们拥有征税、监管，甚至极端点说，没收的权力。
REF: After all, sovereigns are called that because they have the power to impose taxes, regulations, and, at the extreme, confiscation.
PRED: After all, it is called sovereign because it has the power to tax, regulate, or, in the extreme, confiscate.

[161]
ZH: 另外一种信贷危机也同样重要，但其受到的关注却少得多，即使它损坏了社会的凝聚力、生产力以及人们维持自身生活水平的能力（尤其是对底层人群来说 ） 。
REF: But the other credit crisis is equally consequential, and receives much less attention, even as it erodes societies’ integrity, productive capabilities, and ability to maintain living standards (particularly for the least fortunate).
PRED: Another credit crisis is equally important, but it receives far less attention, even if it undermines social cohesion, productivity, and the ability of people to maintain their standard of living, especially among the bottom-up groups.

[162]
ZH: 据我所知，绝大部分西方国家的中小企业、中等收入以及收入拮据的家庭都经历过信贷获取渠道显著下降 — — 不仅针对新的融资，还包括更新过往信贷额度和借款的能力。
REF: I know of very few Western countries where small and medium-size companies, as well as middle-income households and those of more limited means, have not experienced a significant decline in their access to credit – not just new financing, but also the ability to roll over old credit lines and loans.
PRED: As far as I know, most Western countries’ small and medium-sized enterprises, middle-income households, and income-strapped households have experienced significant declines in access to credit – not only for new financing, but also for upgrading their credit lines and borrowing capacity.

[163]
ZH: 这种信贷危机产生的直接原因大家都知道。
REF: The immediate causes are well known.
PRED: The immediate cause of this credit crisis is well known.

[164]
ZH: 其范围涵盖从银行抑制贷款到异常的高风险规避行为、从信贷工具信誉崩溃再到某些机构完全撤出信用中介机构的举措。
REF: They range from subdued bank lending to unusually high risk aversion, and from discredited credit vehicles to the withdrawal of some institutions from credit intermediation altogether.
PRED: It covers initiatives ranging from bank repression of lending to unusual high-risk evasion, from the collapse of credit instruments to the complete withdrawal of some institutions from credit intermediaries.

[165]
ZH: 这种信贷约束是许多国家失业率持续上升的一个原因 — — 通常这些国家的失业率原本已经处于令人担忧的水平了，例如希腊和西班牙25%的失业率（这两个国家的青年失业率已经超过了50 % ） — — 同时也是像美国这样的国家失业率居高不下的原因（虽然相对而言美国的失业率并不高 ） 。
REF: Such credit constraints are one reason why unemployment rates continue to rise in so many countries – often from already alarming levels, such as 25% in Greece and Spain (where youth unemployment is above 50%) – and why unemployment remains unusually high in countries like the US (albeit it at a much lower level).
PRED: This credit constraint is one reason why unemployment continues to rise in many countries – where unemployment is usually already at worrying levels, such as 25% in Greece and Spain, where youth unemployment is already above 50% – and high unemployment in countries like the US, though relatively low.

[166]
ZH: 这不仅仅是生产力流失和贫困加剧的问题；长期的高失业率还会导致社会动荡、对本国政治领导人的不信任以及产生失落一代的风险。
REF: This is not just a matter of lost capabilities and rising poverty; persistently high unemployment also leads to social unrest, erosion of trust in political leaders and institutions, and the mounting risk of a lost generation.
PRED: This is not just a problem of productivity loss and rising poverty; long-term high unemployment can also lead to social unrest, mistrust of political leaders in the country, and the risk of losing a generation.

[167]
ZH: 确实，许多发达国家的失业数据主要由长期失业构成（通常定义为六个月或以上 ） 。
REF: Indeed, unemployment data in many advanced countries are dominated by long-term joblessness (usually defined as six months or more).
PRED: Indeed, unemployment data in many developed countries are predominantly composed of long-term unemployment, usually defined as six months or more.

[168]
ZH: 技能的逐渐丧失对那些原本有工作经验的人来说是个问题，而首次就业不成功则不仅意味着失业这么简单，还隐含着不会被雇佣的风险。
REF: Skill erosion becomes a problem for those with prior work experience, while unsuccessful first-time entrants into the labor force are not just unemployed, but risk becoming unemployable.
PRED: Gradual loss of skills is a problem for those who otherwise have had work experience, and failure to work for the first time means not only that unemployment is simple, but also that there is a risk that they will not be employed.

[169]
ZH: 政府们在处理私人信贷危机上做得太少了。
REF: Governments are doing too little to address the private credit debacle.
PRED: The government has done too little to deal with the private credit crisis.

[170]
ZH: 虽然理论上它们必先解决危机中的主权债务方面；然而目前尚不清楚大部分官员是否制订了一个全面计划。
REF: Arguably, they must first sort out the sovereign side of the crisis; but it is not clear that most officials even have a comprehensive plan.
PRED: Although, theoretically, they must first resolve the sovereign debt aspects of the crisis, it is not clear that most officials have a comprehensive plan.

[171]
ZH: 那些受到主权债务危机影响最剧烈的国家的政策非对称性最为明显。
REF: Policy asymmetry is greatest for the countries most acutely affected by the sovereign-debt crisis.
PRED: The countries most affected by sovereign-debt crises have the most obvious policy asymmetrical.

[172]
ZH: 在这些国家，政府基本上任由私营部门自生自灭；大部分家庭和企业都处在挣扎之中，因此加剧了长期的经济崩溃。
REF: There, the private sector has essentially been left to fend for itself; and most households and companies are struggling, thus fueling continued economic implosion.
PRED: In these countries, governments have largely left the private sector to its own devices; most households and businesses are struggling, thus exacerbating long-term economic collapse.

[173]
ZH: 其他国家则仿佛采取了一种“寻梦之地 ” — —也被称之为“平台建好了，人就来了 ” — —的方法来处理私人信贷市场，例如，在美国，由于美联储的政策措施，人为降低了对住房抵押贷款的利率，以期启动审慎的融资。
REF: Other countries appear to have adopted a “Field of Dreams” – also known as “build it and they will come” – approach to private credit markets, In the US, for example, artificially low interest rates for home mortgages, resulting from the Federal Reserve’s policy activism, are supposed to kick-start prudent financing.
PRED: Others, for their part, seem to have adopted a “dreamplace” – otherwise known as the platform – to deal with private credit markets – for example, in the US, where the Fed’s policy measures have led to artificially reduced interest rates on mortgages in order to initiate prudent financing.

[174]
ZH: 欧洲央行也正在采取这么一个间接手段。
REF: The European Central Bank is taking a similarly indirect approach.
PRED: The ECB is also taking such an indirect approach.

[175]
ZH: 但在这两个地方，掌握有更有力工具的其他政策制定实体似乎既不愿意也无力承担自己的角色。
REF: In both places, other policymaking entities, with much better tools at their disposal, appear either unwilling or unable to play their part.
PRED: But in these two places, other policy-making entities with stronger tools seem to be neither willing nor able to assume their roles.

[176]
ZH: 在这种情况下，央行的行动将一直无法产生足够的牵引力。
REF: As such, action by central banks will repeatedly fail to gain sufficient traction.
PRED: Under these circumstances, central banks’ actions will not be able to generate enough traction.

[177]
ZH: 事实上，只有英国明确选择了更协调也更直接的方式来抵消由私人信贷危机引起的长期短缺。
REF: In fact, only the UK is visibly opting for a more coordinated and direct way to counter the persistent shortfalls stemming from the private part of the credit crisis.
PRED: Indeed, only the United Kingdom has clearly opted for a more coordinated and direct solution to the chronic shortage caused by the private credit crisis.

[178]
ZH: 由英国格兰银行和财政部共同设计的“贷款资助方案”旨在“提高银行和建房互助协会向英国家庭和非金融企业借贷的动力 ” ， 同时也要求前者为自身的行为负责。
REF: There, the “Funding for Lending Scheme,” jointly designed by the Bank of England and the Treasury, seeks “to boost the incentive for banks and building societies to lend to UK households and non-financial companies,” while holding them accountable for proper behavior.
PRED: A loan-financed program, designed by the Bank of Gran and the Treasury, aims to “enhanced banks and mortgage societies to British households and non-financial businesses,” while holding the former accountable for their actions.

[179]
ZH: 英国的例子很重要；但是考虑到整个挑战所涉及的范围和规模 ，该提案还是相对保守的。
REF: The UK example is important; but, given the scope and scale of the challenges, the proposal is a relatively modest one.
PRED: The British example is important; but, given the scope and scale of the challenge, the proposal is relatively conservative.

[180]
ZH: 这一计划也许能刺激一些有益的信用中介行为，但它依然无法对那些继续阻碍强劲经济复苏的因素产生重大影响。
REF: The program may stimulate some productive credit intermediation, but it will not make a significant dent in what will remain one of the major obstacles to robust economic recovery.
PRED: Such a plan might stimulate some beneficial credit intermediation, but it still does not have a significant impact on the factors that continue to impede strong economic recovery.

[181]
ZH: 生产部门能够拥有适当的信贷获取渠道对一个运转良好的经济体来说至关重要。
REF: Proper access to credit for productive segments is an integral part of a well-functioning economy.
PRED: Adequate access to credit for the productive sector is essential for a well-functioning economy.

[182]
ZH: 否则经济增长就将止步不前，也无法充分创造就业，不断扩大的财富与收入差距将腐蚀整个社会结构。
REF: Without it, growth falters, job creation is insufficient, and widening income and wealth inequality undermines the social fabric.
PRED: Otherwise, economic growth will be stalled, as well as full employment creation, and the widening gap between wealth and income will erode the fabric of society as a whole.

[183]
ZH: 这就是为什么任何恢复发达国家经济和金融活力的综合性手段都必须着眼于适当复苏私人信贷流的原因。
REF: That is why any comprehensive approach to restoring the advanced countries’ economic and financial vibrancy must target the proper revival of private credit flows.
PRED: That is why any comprehensive approach to reviving the economies and finances of developed countries must aim at properly reviving private credit flows.

[184]
ZH: 有害的政治学和更好的经济学

[185]
ZH: 纽约—政治学和经济学之间的关系在变化。
REF: NEW YORK – The relationship between politics and economics is changing.
PRED: NEW YORK – The relationship between political science and economics is changing.

[186]
ZH: 发达国家政客陷于古怪并且常常有害的冲突之中，而没有在关于如何摆脱长期不平等低增长时期的问题上按照日益一致的经济共识行事。
REF: Advanced-country politicians are locked in bizarre, often toxic, conflicts, instead of acting on a growing economic consensus about how to escape a protracted period of low and unequal growth.
PRED: Developed-country politicians are caught in eccentric and often harmful conflict, not following the growing economic consensus on how to move beyond a period of chronic inequality and low growth.

[187]
ZH: 这一趋势必须扭转，否则它将破坏发达经济的结构，并让新兴经济体也陷入困境。
REF: This trend must be reversed, before it structurally cripples the advanced world and sweeps up the emerging economies, too.
PRED: This trend must be reversed, otherwise it will undermine the structure of the advanced economies and trap emerging economies.

[188]
ZH: 显然，政治内斗不是什么新鲜事。
REF: Obviously, political infighting is nothing new.
PRED: Obviously, the fight in politics is not new.

[189]
ZH: 但是，直到最近，人们一直认为，如果职业经济学家能就给定的政策方针形成技术官僚一致，政治领导人是能够听进去的。
REF: But, until recently, the expectation was that if professional economists achieved a technocratic consensus on a given policy approach, political leaders would listen.
PRED: Until recently, however, it has been argued that political leaders can listen if professional economists are able to develop technocratic consistency in the policy approach that has been given.

[190]
ZH: 即使有更多激进政党试图推行不同的日程，但强大的力量 — — 不管是来自G7政府的到的劝告、私人资本市场，还是国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界银行贷款的附加条件 — — 几乎总能确保共识方针最终能够胜出。
REF: Even when more radical political parties attempted to push a different agenda, powerful forces – whether moral suasion from G7 governments, private capital markets, or the conditionality attached to International Monetary Fund and World Bank lending – would almost always ensure that the consensus approach eventually won the day.
PRED: Even if more radical political parties try to pursue different agendas, powerful forces – be they advice from the G7 government, private capital markets, or conditionality attached to loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank – can almost always ensure that the consensus approach wins.

[191]
ZH: 比如，从20世纪90年代到21世纪初，所谓的华盛顿共识主导着世界大部的政策决定，从美国到诸多新兴经济体，所有人都在追求贸易自由化、私有化、扩大价格机制用途、金融业去监管，以及着重强调供给侧的财政和货币改革。
REF: In the 1990s and 2000s, for example, the so-called Washington Consensus dominated policymaking in much of the world, with everyone from the United States to a multitude of emerging economies pursuing trade liberalization, privatization, greater use of price mechanisms, financial-sector deregulation, and fiscal and monetary reforms with a heavy supply-side emphasis.
PRED: From the 1990’s to the beginning of the twenty-first century, for example, the so-called Washington Consensus dominated policy decisions in many parts of the world, from the US to emerging economies, in pursuit of trade liberalization, privatization, expansion of the use of price mechanisms, financial regulation, and a strong emphasis on supply-side fiscal and monetary reforms.

[192]
ZH: 多边机构采用华盛顿共识放大的这一传导机制，推动了更广大的经济和金融全球化过程。
REF: The embrace of the Washington Consensus by multilateral institutions amplified its transmission, helping to drive forward the broader process of economic and financial globalization.
PRED: Multilateral institutions have used this mechanism of transmission, magnified by the Washington Consensus, to drive a broader process of economic and financial globalization.

[193]
ZH: 即将上任的新政府 — — 特别是那些由非传统运动的政府，它们之所以能够掌权，依靠的是国内的焦虑情绪和对主流政党的失望 — — 有时华盛顿共识的适当性和重要性有不同意见。
REF: Incoming governments – particularly those led by non-traditional movements, which had risen to power on the back of domestic unease and frustration with mainstream parties – sometimes disagreed with the appropriateness and relevance of the Washington Consensus.
PRED: The incoming new governments – especially those of non-traditional movements, which have been able to take power on the basis of domestic anxiety and frustration with mainstream political parties – sometimes disagree on the appropriateness and importance of the Washington Consensus.

[194]
ZH: 但是，巴西总统卢拉以其著名的2002年政策重点证明，华盛顿共识最后往往还是能够胜出，并且一直主导全局直到两年前希腊总理齐普拉斯采取了同样令人瞩目的一百八十度大转弯。
REF: But, as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva demonstrated with his famous policy pivot in 2002, that consensus tended largely to prevail. And it continued to hold sway as recently as almost two years ago, when Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras executed an equally notable U-turn.
PRED: But, as Brazilian President Lula, with his famous 2002 policy focus, has shown, the Washington Consensus has often been successful in the end, and has dominated the whole picture until two years ago, when Greek Prime Minister Tsipras made an equally remarkable 180-degree turn.

[195]

REF: Advanced-country citizens are frustrated with an “establishment” – including economic “experts,” mainstream political leaders, and dominant multinational companies – which they increasingly blame for their economic travails.
PRED: Developed-country citizens are disappointed with “establishment” – including economic “experts,” mainstream political leaders, and major transnational corporations – and are increasingly being accused of being the main perpetrators of economic hardship.

[197]

REF: Anti-establishment movements and figures have been quick to seize on this frustration, using inflammatory and even combative rhetoric to win support.
PRED: Anti-formed movements and figures quickly seized on this discontent, using inflammatory and even combative rhetoric to gain support.

[198]

PRED: They don’t even need to win elections to interfere with the mechanism of transmission between economics and political science.

[199]
ZH: 6月份，英国以退欧投票证明了这一点 — — 这一决定直接否认了留在欧盟符合英国的最佳利益这一经济共识。

PRED: In June, the UK voted back – a decision that directly denied the economic consensus that it was in the best interest of the UK to remain in the EU.

[200]
ZH: 英国公投的发生原因是，2013年，时任首相卡梅伦担心他在当年的大选中无法确保其保守党基本盘。
REF: The referendum happened for one reason: in 2013, then-Prime Minister David Cameron feared that he would be unable to secure sufficiently his Conservative Party base in the general election that year.
PRED: The British referendum occurred because, in 2013, then Prime Minister Cameron feared that he would not be able to ensure his Conservative Party’s fundamentals during the election that year.

[206]
ZH: 他们还抨击“国际精英 ” ， 批评英格兰银行的政策。 在公投刚刚结束的那段时间，英格兰银行的政策起到了稳定英国经济的中流砥柱的作用，从而给梅的新政府赢得了制定一致的退欧战略的时间。
REF: They also included attacks on “international elites” and criticism of Bank of England policies that were instrumental in stabilizing the British economy in the referendum’s immediate aftermath – thus giving May’s new government time to formulate a coherent Brexit strategy.
PRED: They also criticized “international elites,” and the Bank of England’s policy.

REF: In the US, even if Donald Trump’s presidential campaign fails to put a Republican back in the White House (as appears increasingly likely, given that, in the latest twist of this highly unusual campaign, many Republican leaders have now renounced their party’s nominee), his candidacy will likely leave a lasting impact on American politics.
PRED: In the United States, even if Donald Trump’s election campaign does not allow the Republicans to reopen the White House – a possibility that is growing, given that the rather unusual presidential election has recently turned out to be a new turn, and that many Republican leaders have announced that they no longer support their party’s nominee – the fact that he is a candidate may have a continuing impact on US politics.

PRED: But, in the current political environment, translating this consensus into action may be too slow or impossible to achieve.

REF: For a US economy that is widely presumed to be nearing the hallowed ground of full employment, this comes as a rude awakening – particularly for the Federal Reserve, which has pulled out all the stops to get inflation back to its 2% target.
PRED: For the US economy, which is widely believed to be close to achieving full employment, this is the first cold water – and the most embarrassing is the Fed, which has made every effort to return inflation to its target of 2%.

[226]

PRED: As of April of this year, Japan’s core consumer price index was almost flat compared to the same period last year, and the Tokyo metropolitan world’s economic performance shows that it will be the same in May.

[229]
ZH: 对于为遏制持续19年（1994~2013）累计达19.5％的通缩趋势而动用了史无前例的非常规政策武器库的日本银行来说，这不仅仅是一个盆冷水，简直就是一场近乎失败的窘境。
REF: For the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which committed an unprecedented arsenal of unconventional policy weapons to arrest a 19-year stretch of 16.5% deflation lasting from 1994 to 2013, this is more than just a rude awakening. It is an embarrassment bordering on defeat.
PRED: For the Japanese bank, which has used an unprecedented arsenal of unconventional policy weapons to contain the deflationary trend of 19.5% over 19 years (1994-2013), this is not just a cold water; it is a near-failure dilemma.

[231]
ZH: 当然也存在一些值得留意的异常例子 — — 比如英国，货币压力和一次性假期扭曲暂时将核心通胀率提高至2.4 ％ ， 还有马来西亚，燃料补贴的取消推动了总体通胀，但核心通胀率稳定在2.5％左右。
REF: Yes, there are a few notable outliers – namely, the United Kingdom, where currency pressures and one-off holiday distortions are temporarily boosting core inflation to 2.4%, and Malaysia, where the removal of fuel subsidies has boosted headline inflation, yet left the core stable at around 2.5%.
PRED: There are, of course, unusual examples – for example, in the United Kingdom, where currency pressure and one-time holiday distortions temporarily increased core inflation to 2.4%, and in Malaysia, where the elimination of fuel subsidies pushed overall inflation, but core inflation remained stable at around 2.5%.

[232]
ZH: 但它们都是这个无通胀世界中的例外。

PRED: From asset bubbles and excess leverage to exchange-rate repression and declining productivity, Japan’s experience – the so-called “lost decade” now stretches to 25 years – illustrates all the mistakes that a large, rich economy may have made.

[237]
ZH: 但没什么教训能比日本央行犯下的一系列政策失误更为深刻。
REF: But no lesson is more profound than that of a series of policy blunders made by the BoJ.
PRED: But there are few lessons to be learned that are deeper than the series of policy failures that the Central Bank of Japan has committed.

[238]
ZH: 不仅使用鲁莽的货币宽松政策为日本的衰亡奠定了基础；该国央行还将政策利率归零（甚至更低 ） ， 实施量化宽松政策和操纵长期利率以期复兴经济，却令问题变得更为复杂。
REF: Not only did reckless monetary accommodation set the stage for Japan’s demise; the country’s central bank compounded the problem by taking policy rates to the zero bound (and even lower), embracing quantitative easing, and manipulating long-term interest rates in the hopes of reviving the economy.
PRED: Not only did reckless monetary easing be used to lay the foundation for Japan’s decline; the central bank’s policy interest rate was zero (or even lower), and quantitative easing and the manipulation of long-term interest rates to revive the economy made the problem even more complicated.

[239]

[243]
ZH: 2017年的通胀意外事件提供了三个关键的见解。
REF: The inflation surprise of 2017 offers three key insights.
PRED: The inflation accident of 2017 provided three key insights.

[244]
ZH: 首先，通货膨胀与经济萧条程度之间的关系 — — 即所谓的菲利普斯曲线（Phillips curve ） — —已经瓦解了。
REF: First, the relationship between inflation and economic slack – the so-called Phillips curve – has broken down.
PRED: First, the relationship between inflation and the degree of economic depression – the so-called Phillips curve – has collapsed.

[245]
ZH: 拜日内瓦大学教授理查德·鲍德温（Richard Baldwin）所谓的全球化“第二次分割”所赐，世界上因此充斥着供应过剩且日益分散化的全球供应链。
REF: Courtesy of what the University of Geneva’s Richard Baldwin calls the “second unbundling” of globalization, the world is awash in the excess supply of increasingly fragmented global supply chains.
PRED: Thanks to what the University of Geneva professor Richard Baldwin called a “second split” of globalization, the world is rife with oversupply and increasingly fragmented global supply chains.

[246]
ZH: 而借助这些供应链的外包大大扩大了全球供应曲线的弹性，并从根本上改变了劳动力和产品市场萧条的概念，以及这类萧条状态对通胀的压力。
REF: Outsourcing via these supply chains dramatically expands the elasticity of the global supply curve, fundamentally altering the concept of slack in labor and product markets, as well as the pressure such slack might put on inflation.
PRED: By outsourcing these supply chains, the elasticity of the global supply curves has greatly expanded, and fundamentally changed the concept of depressed labor and product markets, and the pressure on inflation from such depressions.

[247]
ZH: 其次，当今的全球化在本质上是不对称的。
REF: Second, today’s globalization is inherently asymmetric.
PRED: Second, today’s globalization is essentially asymmetrical.

[248]
ZH: 由于各种原因 — — 日本和美国资产负债表的持续衰退，恐惧驱动下的中国国内预防性储蓄，以及欧洲生产力受限导致的消费疲软 — — 大多数主要经济体的需求侧依然受损严重。
REF: For a variety of reasons – hangovers from balance-sheet recessions in Japan and the US, fear-driven precautionary saving in China, and anemic consumption in productivity-constrained Europe – the demand side of most major economies remains severely impaired.
PRED: For a variety of reasons – the continued recession in Japan’s and the US balance sheets, fear-driven Chinese domestic preventive saving, and weak consumption due to productivity constraints in Europe – the demand side of most major economies continues to be severely undermined.

[249]
ZH: 再结合供应不断扩大的背景，因此导致的不平衡状态在本质上是通缩式的。
REF: Juxtaposed against a backdrop of ever-expanding supply, the resulting imbalance is inherently deflationary.
PRED: In combination with the expanding supply context, the resulting imbalance is inherently deflationary.

[250]
ZH: 第三，中央银行在应对所谓的非平稳流动性陷阱的变动目标方面都是无能为力的。
REF: Third, central banks are all but powerless to cope with the moving target of what can be called a non-stationary liquidity trap.
PRED: Third, central banks have been unable to cope with the changing goals of the so-called unsmooth liquidity trap.

[251]
ZH: 正如约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯（John Maynard Keynes）在1930年代大萧条时首先观察到的那样，流动性陷阱描述了一个政策利率已达零点，却依旧无法刺激长期缺乏的总需求的状况。
REF: First observed by John Maynard Keynes during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the liquidity trap describes a situation in which policy interest rates, having reached the zero bound, are unable to stimulate chronically deficient aggregate demand.
PRED: As John Maynard Keynes first observed in the 1930’s during the Great Depression, the liquidity trap depicts a policy interest rate that has reached zero, but that still fails to stimulate chronicly lacking aggregate demand.

[252]
ZH: 这听起来是不是有点耳熟？
REF: Sound familiar?
PRED: Does that sound familiar to you?

[253]
ZH: 而如今使用的新花招则是不断扩张的全球供应曲线。
REF: The novel twist today is the ever-expanding global supply curve.
PRED: And the new methods used today are the expanding global supply curve.

[254]
ZH: 这使得今天的中行比1930年代更加束手无策。
REF: That makes today’s central banks even more impotent than they were in the 1930s.
PRED: This makes today’s middle-class business even more incompetent than in the 1930’s.

[255]
ZH: 这可不是不治之症。
REF: This is not an incurable disease.
PRED: This is not an incurable disease.

[256]
ZH: 在一个超全球化的世界 — — 除了由美国优先主义者领导的保护主义逆流之外 — — 应对方案应当集中在等式的需求一侧。
REF: In a world of hyper-globalization – barring a protectionist relapse led by the America Firsters – treatment needs to be focused on the demand side of the equation.
PRED: In a ultra-global world – apart from the protectionist reversals led by the US’s priorityists – solutions should be focused on the demand side of the equation.

[257]
ZH: 而1930年代以及从现代日本的经验带来的最重要教训，就是货币政策对总需求的长期缺乏状况无计可施。
REF: The most important lesson from the 1930s, as well as from the modern-day Japanese experience, is that monetary policy provides no answer for a chronic deficiency of aggregate demand.
PRED: And the most important lesson from the 1930’s and from the experience of modern Japan is that monetary policy has failed to respond to a chronic shortage of aggregate demand.

[258]
ZH: 解决这个问题主要得靠财政部门，中行应该考虑再度许诺提高其通胀目标的想法是不可靠的。
REF: Addressing it is a task primarily for fiscal authorities. The idea that central banks should consider making a new promise to raise their inflation targets is hardly credible.
PRED: The solution lies primarily in the financial sector, and it is not credible that the Chinese should consider renewing their promises to raise their inflation targets.

[259]
ZH: 与此同时，美联储主席珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen ） （ 最后终于）作出了正确的决定，推动美联储的政策正常化，终结了一个早该因一无是处而刹车的错误实验。
REF: In the meantime, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is right (finally) to push the Fed to normalize policy, putting an end to a failed experiment that has long outlived its usefulness.
PRED: Meanwhile, US Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen (and finally) made the right decision to normalize the Fed’s policy, putting an end to a wrong experiment that should have been stopped for nothing.

[260]
ZH: 一直以来的危险在于：不是何时才是尽头的非常规货币宽松政策将无法对实体经济构成牵引力，并将过多的流动性注入了美国和全球金融市场，从而导致资产泡沫，肆意金融冒险和下一次危机。
REF: The danger all along has been that open-ended unconventional monetary easing would fail to achieve traction in the real economy, and would inject excess liquidity into US and global financial markets that could lead to asset bubbles, reckless risk taking, and the next crisis.
PRED: The danger has always been that unconventional monetary easing, when it will end, will not create a drag on the real economy, and will inject excessive liquidity into US and global financial markets, leading to asset bubbles, reckless financial risk-taking, and the next crisis.

[261]
ZH: 此外，由于非常规宽松政策是为了一个不再存在的紧急状态而制定的战略，因此也使得美联储没有弹药来应对不可避免的下一轮衰退和危机。
REF: Moreover, because unconventional easing was a strategy designed for an emergency that no longer exists, it leaves the Fed with no ammunition to fight the inevitable next downturn and crisis.
PRED: Moreover, because unconventional easing is a strategy for a state of emergency that no longer exists, the Fed is left with no ammunition to cope with the inevitable next round of recession and crisis.

[262]
ZH: 我们对历史的忽视是存在极大危险的。
REF: We ignore history at great peril.
PRED: Our neglect of history is extremely dangerous.

[263]
ZH: 以通胀为目标的各大央行最近的铩羽而归根本不是一个意外，相关的长期利率下跌也是如此。
REF: The latest disappointment for inflation-targeting central banks is really not a surprise after all. The same is true of the related drop in long-term interest rates.
PRED: The recent collapse of major central banks that target inflation has not been an accident, nor has the related decline in long-term interest rates.

[264]
ZH: 仔细学习日本的教训，必定获益良多。

REF: PRINCETON – Last week, in a highly anticipated speech, German President Joachim Gauck cautioned against the blind pursuit of an “ever-closer” European Union, acknowledging that the growing inequality among member states is generating “a sense of unease, even unmistakable anger,” and increasing the risk of national humiliation.
PRED: PRINCETON – Last week, in a much-awaited speech, German Chancellor Gorker expressed concern at the blind pursuit of the “unprecedented closeness” of the EU, acknowledging that growing inequality among its members is generating “a sense of anxiety, or even a false anger,” which increases the risk of national humiliation.

[270]

REF: Addressing this hesitation, he declared, will require a thoughtful, nuanced understanding of what “more Europe” actually means.
PRED: He said that it was time to overcome this hesitation and think deeply and carefully about the true meaning of “more Europe.”

[271]

REF: Gauck may not have gone far enough: At this point, an ever-closer union may be a political mirage.
PRED: Perhaps Gork has not gone far enough: an unprecedentedly close alliance could be a political marriage.

[272]

REF: Any meaningful progress toward stabilizing the eurozone would require a significant – potentially open-ended – financial commitment, and the EU is not politically ready to cross that threshold.
PRED: Any meaningful progress to make the eurozone more stable will require significant – and fundamentally open – fiscal commitment, and the EU is not yet prepared to cross one of the thresholds.

REF: Repeatedly pretending to move forward, then pulling back at the critical point, exacerbates political uncertainty and economic vulnerability.
PRED: Pretending repeatedly to move forward, and then retreating at critical points, increases political uncertainty and economic vulnerability.

[274]

REF: Rather than indecisively pursuing more unity, this may be the moment to restore effective sovereignty to national authorities in eurozone countries.
PRED: This may not be the time to hesitate to pursue a more unified approach, but the time to restore effective sovereignty to the eurozone’s national authorities.

[275]
ZH: 这样做能够在短期缓和焦虑，从而使欧洲得到重组机会，为未来迈向更一体化的欧洲和更坚挺的欧元做好准备。
REF: Such a move would alleviate anxiety in the short term, thereby giving Europeans the opportunity to regroup in preparation for future steps toward a more integrated Europe and a more resilient euro.

REF: To this end, eurozone leaders must take three key steps.
PRED: In this regard, eurozone leaders must implement three basic measures.

[277]
ZH: 功能不全的欧洲财政治理制度应该取消；财政责任应该交还给成员国；同时，为了让未来过度借贷最小化，应该要求私人债权人承担不可持续的主权债务的损失。
REF: The dysfunctional system of European fiscal governance should be dismantled; fiscal responsibility should be returned to member states; and, to minimize the risk of excessive future lending, private lenders should be required to bear the losses implied by unsustainable sovereign debt.

REF: Either the target was openly flouted, as it was in leading economies like Germany and France, or the data were manipulated to obscure problems (a common practice throughout the eurozone, not just in Greece).
PRED: Some advanced economies, such as Germany and France, have openly set the goal, while others have manipulated numbers to hide the problem (which is common in the eurozone, not only in Greece).

PRED: The idea of economic growth as a fiscal panacea has led to unrealistically optimistic GDP expectations.

[282]

REF: When the crisis struck, the 3% deficit target became the focal point for unrelenting austerity – a form of what anthropologist Clifford Geertz described as “involution,” which occurs when a process intensifies rather than changes in response to external or internal pressure.
PRED: After the crisis erupted, the 3% deficit target became the focus of a relentless austerity policy – anthropologist Clifford Geertz called this form “internally” – when a process was aggravated, not changed, by external or internal pressure.

PRED: As fiscal indicators become more complex, fiscal behaviour is becoming easier to monitor.

[285]

REF: The case for returning fiscal responsibility to national authorities is also strong – and not only because centralized fiscal authority has proved to be so inefficient.
PRED: The question of transferring fiscal responsibility to national authorities is also enormous – not least because centralized fiscal authorities have proved to be extremely inefficient.

[286]

REF: The eurozone was founded on the “no bailout” principle: if member states could not repay their debts, lenders would bear the losses.
